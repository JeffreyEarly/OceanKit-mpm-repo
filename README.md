# OceanKit
A MATLAB package repository for a wide variety of oceanography related tools.

Clone this repository, e.g., execute
```
git clone https://github.com/JeffreyEarly/OceanKit.git
```
from the command-line. Within Matlab, add this folder as an MPM repository,
```matlab
mpmAddRepository("OceanKit","path/to/folder/OceanKit.git")
```
and then install any package you need,
```matlab
mpminstall("distributions")
```
from the list below. The dependent packages will automatically be installed.

### Advanced
Note that if you intend to make changes to package to be committed back to github, you will need to check out the repo of interest directly. For example, you'd call
```
git clone https://github.com/JeffreyEarly/distributions
```
to clone the repo, and then directly install package
```matlab
mpminstall("local/path/to/distributions", Authoring=true); 
```
with authoring enabled.
